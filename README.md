# TurboPower-FlashFiler-1.x-Database-Interface
You have the converter which you can use to convert ff1 tables to ff2 tables, and it is definitely recommended to use ff2 tables instead if you were to use this old database system. However, some programs use the very old ff1 database system and it is tedious to convert to ff2 and since it is coded in delphi, it is not always as easy to use the ff2 libraries. So mainly because of a project of my own, I managed to figure out how reading of ff1 database tables work and created a c++ interface library that works for both c/c++ and c#.

**NOTE**: This is completely unofficial and I am not related to the original authors of FlashFiler (by TurboPower) in any way.

The interface is tested and should work both in C/C++ and C#. Look below for usage.
